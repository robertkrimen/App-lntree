NAME
    App::lntree - Create a best-effort symlink-based mirror of a directory

VERSION
    version 0.0012

SYNOPSIS
        lntree ~/project1 target/
        lntree ~/project2 target/

        # target/ is now a combination of project1 & project2, with project2 taking precedence

DESCRIPTION
    App::lntree is a utility for making a best-effort symlink-based mirror
    of a directory. The algorithm is:

        - Directories are always recreated, NOT symlinked
        - A symlink conflict will be resolved by removing the original symlink
        - Regular files (including directories) are left untouched

USAGE
  lntree <source> <target>
    Create a symlink mirror of <source> into <target>, creating <target> if
    necessary
